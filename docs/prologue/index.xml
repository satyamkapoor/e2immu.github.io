We recommend The Road to Immutability → as a first introduction to the analyser. This document is also available as PDF in the Tutorials → section.
All downloads (sources, jars) can be found on e2immu&amp;rsquo;s GitHub page →.
Timeline e2immu is not ready yet. While all concepts are stable, the analyser is not robust enough yet to be applied in production settings.
We try to adhere to the following timing:</description></item><item><title>Tutorials</title><link>https://www.e2immu.org/docs/prologue/tutorials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.e2immu.org/docs/prologue/tutorials/</guid><description>The main tutorial to the concepts of the e2immu analyser is:

The project welcomes contributions from the community.
Goal IBTECH aims for the e2immu analyser to become a solid, dependable tool in promoting and enforcing immutability constraints in recent versions of Java. Until this goal is reached, it will try to avoid widening the scope of the analyser in the direction of, for example, a general code analyser, or the ability to analyser other programming languages.</description></item></channel></rss>
